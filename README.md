# File Comparison Tool
This repository contains a python program that allows you to compare two files to determine if they are copied from one another. The program uses a simple comparison algorithm based on the number of common words between the two files, and returns a match percentage indicating the similarity of the contents of the files.

## Features

- Select two files from your local computer
- Compare the contents of the two files
- Get a percentage match between the two files
- Get a message indicating if the two files match or not

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
